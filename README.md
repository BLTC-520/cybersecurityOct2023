This is the whole file you need to complete your cybersecurity assignment (oct trimester). 

Steps:
1. git clone this whole repo to your local
2. keep them in the same folder
3. Open your cmd
4. Good to go! (running hashcat command to break your files!)

The hash1-5.txt already remove the unnecessary parts. Feel free to use!

Very very first step, create a github account. Then download git. (Pre-req to use this) - search online resources how to download and install

Then open your cmd to git clone the whole file to your local machine.

After that, cmd your directory to this file. 

Then start running hashcat command. 

Before I give you the answer, learn from this command: (all you need to know) 
hashcat --help
